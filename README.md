## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## How to Set Up the Project

After cloning the repository, follow these steps to set up the Laravel application:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install PHP dependencies using Composer:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

   Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create and Configure the `.env` File**:
   Copy the example `.env` file and configure the environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other configurations.

5. **Generate Application Key**:
   Generate a new application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Run Database Migrations**:
   Migrate the database to create the required tables:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Run Frontend Build Tools**:
   Compile the frontend assets:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

8. **Serve the Application**:
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   composer run dev
   ```

   Your application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Additional Notes
- If the project uses Laravel Sail (optional), you can start the application using Docker. Refer to the Laravel Sail documentation for more information.
- If there are seeded data in the repository, you can use:
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```
- Ensure you have all required software installed, such as PHP, Composer, Node.js, and a database (e.g., MySQL).

Your Laravel application will now include a basic authentication system with registration, login, password reset, and email verification features.
